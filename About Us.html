<h1>My Why into spreading the word </h1>

<P> Ever since I started planning my schedule for the day or even the week, I have noticed a significant change in time management and in seeing how much time is truly available within a seven-day period.
  I believe that everyone should have some sort of planner when it comes to seeing what task they have to tackle over the week and by doing so, they can save themselves a significant amount of time for personal things that they want to accomplish.  
</P>

<p> Not only should people plan their week, but they should also make a list of what they want/need such as a grocery list, from a calendar software to plan each week, and a to-do list for the day 
  of what needs to be done that day. By doing so, the available free time can help people not only do this as if it were second nature. They can influence other people to start having
  a to-do list and so on and so on.
