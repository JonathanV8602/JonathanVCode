      <p>Hello, My name is Jonathan (Prefer Jon) and these are my prefered tips and tricks of taking control of time. I am very fond of making sure that I have an organized day by writing down what I need to accomplish by the end of the week and finishing up my list early means more personal free time.</p>
      <p>In the main body of this website, you will see a list of things that I tested or did my research on to have some help when making a list of sorts. Depending on what you are looking for, I am hoping that my personal experience if not research, on this Software To-Do list can help you personally to become a well-organized person overall.</p>
